for moomath!
What is life? Is it just a slow fall into depression as we struggle and fail to leave an imprint on this sadistic world?
For whom do we work for? What do we work for? Does the world continue after we die?
Is life an illusion, is this earth some imagined place in the mind of some tyrant?
What other explination could there be for war?
Inequality, famine, injustice?
How do any one of us know that this world isn't a dream?
That all our contributions melt when we wake up.
How could you or me, the imaginer, ever dream up so much suffering and hate?
The dreamer imagined every serial killer and terrorist to grace this earth.
Or worse... If this world is real.
Just thinking of what us, the humans, have done makes me sick.
What is the point of life? To suffer? To indulge? To power some sick wheel of eternity with our efforts?

Use these programs to get some more time to suffer!
CHEM programs will surely save your time as you slave away doing homework!
Play some videogames and pump yourself full of dopamine!

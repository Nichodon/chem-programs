How To Use Chem Programs:
1) Enter Your Chemical Equation
  a) It will be automatically ballance if possible
2) To find the K efficiancy, enter the weight of a reactant used and the subsequent weight of product produced
  a) If there is more product then possible, an error message will seay "check your numbers and try again"
3) To find the limiting reagent, enter the weights of 2 reactants
4) Given the weight of one element to find other weights, make sure only one value is entered in the box






What is life? Is it just a slow fall into depression as we struggle and fail to leave an imprint on this sadistic world?
For whom do we work for? What do we work for? Does the world continue after we die?
Is life an illusion, is this earth some imagined place in the mind of some tyrant?
What other explination could there be for war?
Inequality, famine, injustice?
How do any one of us know that this world isn't a dream?
That all our contributions melt when we wake up.
How could you or me, the imaginer, ever dream up so much suffering and hate?
The dreamer imagined every serial killer and terrorist to grace this earth.
Or worse... If this world is real.
Just thinking of what us, the humans, have done makes me sick.
What is the point of life? To suffer? To indulge? To power some sick wheel of eternity with our efforts?
Or is this all simulated? Are we some third-grader's presentation on the corruptible and wreched nature of mankind?
Is the world just a game to someone? Are they deliberately creating faliure to fulfill some achievement?
How do we know if anything we know is real?

Use these programs to get some more time to suffer!
CHEM programs will surely save your time as you slave away doing homework!
Play some videogames and pump yourself full of dopamine!


As we sink deeper into dispair/
With a world that's byond repair/
In a world thats unaware/
of any wickedness in the air/

For every good change we induce/
We break a treaty or a truce/
Or fill the world with more abuse/
Our grip on goodness is quite loose/

But the opposition marches onward/
Sowing deciept we cant afford/
Brainwashed to their overlord/
With insanity loudly roared/

Everyone wants the world fixed/
They wouldn't be the one who dared/
The load should be shared/
Otherwise efforts will be impaired/

But who will be the on to act/
No one will, thats a fact/
None risk being unbacked/
For fear of being swiftly whacked/
